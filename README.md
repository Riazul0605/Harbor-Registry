# Harbor-Registry
What is Harbor Registry?

Harbor is an open-source container image registry that secures and manages container images (and Helm charts).
It extends Docker Registry by adding enterprise-grade features.

Think of it as:
A private Docker Hub, but with more security, RBAC, vulnerability scanning, and replication.
